# Two4H Frontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.3.
Project was split on backend and frontend part, both available on my GitHub (https://github.com/koszatree?tab=repositories) named consecutively Two4H (for backend) and Two4H-Frontend-New (for frontend).

***

Project started as group work on last year of my Bachelor studies and I decided to continue it's development to improve my programming skills.
Right now it supports features such as: register and login; user management from admin panel (listing, editing), also managing shops and products (listing, creating, editing).
I am currently working on Shop Owner panel, fixes and improvement of Admin's page.
In the future I will implement API for maps to locate shops and enable shopping with delivery.
The project will also use containerization via Docker.
